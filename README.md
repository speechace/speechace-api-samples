# SpeechAce API Samples

This repo contains sample programs that demonstrate how to use the SpeechAce (www.speechace.com) speech recognition API. 

The SpeechAce API is designed specifically to help language learners improve their pronunciation. It accepts an audio file and
a text string and provides a variety of metrics that help establish the quality of the speech in the audio file. Key metrics 
include:

1. Phoneme, syllable, word and sentence level quality score indicating how closely the speaker in the audio matches a native
English speaker.
2. Fluency metrics such as words correct per minute, number of pauses, IELTS/PTE scores.

The API can be used to build a variety of pronunciation training and assessment activities including:
1. Word and Sentence level pronunciation assessment
2. Passage level Fluency assessment
3. Estimating IELTS Speaking score and PTE Speaking score
4. Speaking activities (e.g. Flashcards, fill in the blank, multiple choice)

Detailed documentation on the API is available at https://docs.speechace.com
